> Task :

- Perform Cohort Analysis on the Transactions Sheet provided in the Dataset to monitor and  understand Customer Retention Rate

>Conclusion and Cohort Analysis Importance :

- Know how user behaviors affect your business. Cohort analysis allows you to see how actions those in the cohort took or didnâ€™t take translate into changes in business metrics, such as acquisition and retention.
- Understand customer churn. You can marshal your data to assess your hypotheses regarding whether one customer action or attribute leads to another, such as whether sign-ups related to a specific promotions encourage greater churn.
- Calculate customer lifetime value. Analyzing cohorts based on acquisition time period, such as grouping customers by the month they signed up, allows you to see how much customers are worth to the company over time. You can then further group these cohorts by time, segment, and size to assess which acquisition channels lead to the best customer lifetime value (CLV).
- Optimize your conversion funnel. Comparing customers who engaged in various ways at given times with your sales process can allow you to see how user experience throughout the digital marketing funnel translates to value in your customers.
- Create more effective customer engagement. As you see patterns in how various cohorts engage with your company, and product you can take steps that will encourage all customers to take various actions more efficiently.
