Task :Clustering Experiments on Big Transaction Data for Market/Customer Segmentation,

**Customer segmentation** is one of the most important tasks in any business, gaining insights into your customers' purchasing behavior and/or understanding reasons for churn, customer retention, seamless customer experience and bottlenecks to customers' base growth is crucial for all areas concerning that business.

For business purposes RFM Analysis, “recency, frequency, monetary,” represents some of the most important attributes of a customer from a company’s point of view, to conduct the clustering analysis, collecting the relevant data on each customer and sort customers into groups based on similar values for each of the RFM variables.

In that Notebook I've represented a public dataset analysis for Customer Segmentation Using K-means and RFM approach, results of the analysis are:

The Best clusters using K-means unsupervised machine learning model and Silhouette metric were found to be 3
Cluster No 1 has an average spending of > 6000, frequency of purchase about > 240 times and recency of 14 days
